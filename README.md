# Strategic Marketing Intake System

## Overview

A next-generation marketing intake system built with LangGraph, LangChain, and adaptive intelligence for strategic lead qualification and market intelligence gathering.

## Vision

This system will replace legacy agent-based architectures with:

- **Adaptive Questioning**: Dynamic intake forms that adapt based on user type, industry, and responses
- **Market Intelligence Integration**: Real-time market data from ADAPT/Switch 6 for intelligent ICP generation
- **Strategic Orchestration**: LangGraph-powered workflows for intelligent lead qualification
- **Position Validation**: Automated validation of positioning and messaging fit

## Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **LangGraph**: Advanced workflow orchestration and state management
- **LangChain**: Intelligent agent coordination and tool integration
- **Adaptive Intake Engine**: Dynamic form generation based on context
- **Market Intelligence API**: Real-time market data integration
- **Strategic Validation**: Automated positioning and ICP analysis

### Key Features
- Dynamic questionnaire adaptation
- Real-time market intelligence integration
- Intelligent lead scoring and qualification
- Automated positioning validation
- Strategic workflow orchestration
- Context-aware agent coordination

## Getting Started

This is a fresh rebuild - stay tuned for setup instructions once the strategic architecture is implemented.

## Legacy Notice

This repository previously contained basic agent orchestration and web crawling functionality. That legacy system has been completely removed to make way for the strategic rebuild with modern LangGraph/LangChain architecture.

## Next Steps

1. Implement LangGraph orchestration framework
2. Build adaptive intake engine
3. Integrate market intelligence APIs
4. Develop strategic validation algorithms
5. Create intelligent agent coordination system
